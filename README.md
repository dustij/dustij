I'm a Computer Science undergrad who builds websites, creates mobile apps, and practices competitive programming. 

My languages and frameworks are:
- JavaScript/TypeScript (Next.js)
- Dart (Flutter)
- Java
- Python

I write maintainble code by focusing on high cohesion and small classes. I enjoy building things and want to collaborate.

You can reach me on LinkedIn or by [email](mailto:dustijohnson@outlook.com)!
